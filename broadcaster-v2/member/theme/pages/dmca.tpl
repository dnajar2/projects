			<span class="subtitle">Abuse Notification:</span> Abusing the DMCA
			Notice procedures set forth above, or misrepresenting facts in a DMCA
			Notice or Counter-notification, can result in legal liability for
			damages, court costs and attorneys fees under federal law. See; <a
				href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/17/5/512"
				title="17 U.S.C. Â§ 512(f)" target="_blank">17 U.S.C. § 512(f)</a>.
			These Notice and Takedown Procedures only apply to claims of
			copyright infringement by copyright holders and their agents not to
			any other kind of abuse, infringement or legal claim. We will
			investigate and take action against anyone abusing the DMCA
			notification or counter-notification procedure. Please ensure that

			Notice to our Designated Agent.
		</p>

		<p class="subtitle">Take Down Procedure</p>

		<p>The SITE implements the following notification and takedown
			procedure upon receipt of any notification of claimed copyright
			infringement. The SITE reserves the right at any time to disable
			access to, or remove any material or activity accessible on or from
			any SITE or any Materials claimed to be infringing or based on facts
			or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent. It is
			the firm policy of the SITE to terminate the account of repeat
			copyright infringers, when appropriate, and the SITE will act
			expeditiously to remove access to all material that infringes on
			anothers copyright, according to the procedure set forth in 17 U.S.C.
			§512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The SITE DMCA
			Notice Procedures are set forth in the preceding paragraph. If the
			notice does not comply with §512 of the DMCA, but does comply with
			three requirements for identifying sites that are infringing
			according to §512 of the DMCA, the SITE shall attempt to contact or
			take other reasonable steps to contact the complaining party to help
			that party comply with the notice requirements. When the Designated
			Agent receives a valid notice, the SITE will expeditiously remove
			and/or disable access to the infringing material and shall notify the
			affected user. Then, the affected user may submit a
			counter-notification to the Designated Agent containing a statement
			made under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief
			that the material was removed because of misidentification of the
			material. After the Designated Agent receives the
			counter-notification, it will replace the material at issue within
			10-14 days after receipt of the counter-notification unless the
			Designated Agent receives notice that a court action has been filed
			by the complaining party seeking an injunction against the infringing
			activity. The SITE reserves the right to modify, alter or add to this
			policy, and all users should regularly check back to these Terms and
			Conditions to stay current on any such changes.</p>

		<p class="subtitle">DMCA Counter-Notification Procedure</p>

		<p>If the Recipient of a Notice of Claimed Infringement ("Notice")
			believes that the Notice is erroneous or false, and/or that allegedly
			infringing material has been wrongly removed in accordance with the
			procedures outlined above, the Recipient is permitted to submit a
			counter-notification pursuant to Section 512(g)(2)&(3) of the DMCA. A
			counter-notification is the proper method for the Recipient to
			dispute the removal or disabling of material pursuant to a Notice.
			The information that a Recipient provides in a counter-notification
			must be accurate and truthful, and the Recipient will be liable for
			any misrepresentations which may cause any claims to be brought
			against the SITE relating to the actions taken in response to the
			counter-notification.</p>

		<p>To submit a counter-notification, please provide Our Designated
			Copyright agent the following information:</p>

		<p>(a) a specific description of the material that was removed or
			disabled pursuant to the Notice;</p>

		<p>(b) a description of where the material was located within the SITE
			or the Content before such material was removed and/or disabled
			(preferably including specific url associated with the material);</p>

		<p>(c) a statement reflecting the Recipient's belief that the removal
			or disabling of the material was done so erroneously. For
			convenience, the following format may be used:</p>

		<em>I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief
			that the referenced material was removed or disabled by the service
			provider as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material
			to be removed or disabled.</em><br><br>

		<p>1. the Recipient's physical address, telephone number, and email
			address; and,</p>


		<p>(e) a statement that the Recipient consents to the jurisdiction of
			the Federal District Court in and for the judicial district where the
			Recipient is located, or if the Recipient is outside of the United
			States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may
			be found, and that the Recipient will accept service of process from
			the person who provided the Notice, or that persons agent.</p>

		<p>Written notification containing the above information must be
			signed and sent to:
		</p>
		<address>
			<p>
				Lawrence G. Walters<br> <span class="subtitle">Walters Law Group</span><br>
				195 W. Pine Ave.<br> Longwood, FL 32750<br> Notice [at] DMCANotice
				[dot] com
			</p>
		</address>

		<p class="bold-text">Please do not send other
			inquires or information to our Designated Agent. Absent prior express
			permission, our Designated Agent is not authorized to accept or waive
			service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond
			that required to accept valid DMCA Notices is expressly disclaimed.</p>

		<p>After receiving a DMCA-compliant counter-notification, Our
			Designated Copyright Agent will forward it to Us, and We will then
			provide the counter-notification to the claimant who first sent the
			original Notice identifying the allegedly infringing content.</p>

		<p>Thereafter, within ten to fourteen (10-14) days of Our receipt of a
			counter-notification, We will replace or cease disabling access to
			the disputed material provided that We or Our Designated Copyright
			Agent have not received notice that the original claimant has filed
			an action seeking a court order to restrain the Recipient from
			engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the
			SITE system or network.</p>

		<p class="subtitle">Service Provider Customers or Subscribers</p>

		<p>In the event that the alleged infringer identified in an intended
			DMCA Notice is, itself, operating as a Service Provider within
			the meaning of 17 U.S.C. § 512(k)(1), the SITE requests that any
			such DMCA Notices relating to alleged infringement by third party
			users, customers or subscribers of such service providers be
			submitted directly to the DMCA Agent designated by the service
			provider instead of the SITE.</p>

		<p class="subtitle">Modifications to Policy</p>

		<p>The SITE reserves the right to modify, alter or add to this policy,
			and all affected persons should regularly check back regularly to
			stay current on any such changes.</p>

		<p class="subtitle">Customer Service Requests</p>

		<p>Please note that the DMCA Agent is not associated with the Site in
			any other capacity, but is an attorney with a private law firm.
			Customer service inquiries, payment questions, and cancellation
			requests will not receive a response. All such communications must be
			directed to the Site's customer service department.</p>
