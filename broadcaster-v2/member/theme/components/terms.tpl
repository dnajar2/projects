                <li>Our websites are different from many other sites on the
                    Internet as they contain communications provided by users and
                    third parties that may be outside of our direct control.</li>
                <li>Through the use of these Terms and Conditions, we are placing
                    legal conditions on your use of these websites (<a
                            href="http://www.{$whitelabel_settings.name}.com">www.{$whitelabel_settings.name}.com</a>,
                    hereinafter the "Websites"), and making certain promises to you.
                </li>
                <li>Our first condition is that you must agree to all of the
                    conditions in this set of Terms and Conditions of use (hereinafter
                    "T&amp;C's" or "Agreement"). You do not need to use our Websites,
                    therefore if you do not wish to be bound by each and every
                    provision in this Agreement, then you are not welcome to use these
                    Websites and should leave and use another service.</li>
                <li>You may not unilaterally disregard any portion of this
                    Agreement. However, if there is a particular portion of this
                    Agreement that you wish to avoid, you may contact us to negotiate
                    a separate agreement BEFORE you use the Websites. We do not
                    guarantee that such negotiations will be successful. Nevertheless,
                    if you wish to discuss your own personalized Agreement, please
                    contact us or have your attorney do so.</li>

                            It should be obvious, but for the sake of legal clarity, when

                            "our," "ours," etc., those first-person pronouns are referring
                            to {if $whitelabel_settings.name} {$whitelabel_settings.name}

                    received upon Your viewing or downloading any portion of Our
                    Websites.</li>
                <li>Revisions to this Agreement
                    <ol>
                        <li>From time to time, We may revise this Agreement. We reserve
                            the right to do so, and You specifically agree that We have this
                            unilateral right. You agree that all modifications or changes to

                            updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions
                            immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no
                            continuing legal effect.</li>
                        <li>If We change anything in this Agreement, We will change the
                            "last modified date" at the top of this Agreement. You agree to
                            re-visit this web page on a weekly basis, and to use the

                            Agreement. If the "last modified" date remains unchanged from
                            the last time You reviewed this Agreement, then You may presume
                            that nothing in the Agreement has been changed since the last
                            time You read it. If the "last modified" date has changed, then
                            You can be certain that something in the Agreement has been
                            changed, and you agree that you will re-review the Agreement in
                            its entirety and that You will agree to its terms or immediately

                            to determine if any of the terms have changed, You assume all
                            responsibility for such omissions and You agree that such
                            failure amounts to Your affirmative waiver of Your right to
                            review the amended terms. We are not responsible for Your
                            neglect of Your legal rights.</li>

                    misuse, or inability to use the Websites or any of the Materials
                    contained therein, or Your breach of any part of this Agreement.
                    We shall promptly notify You by electronic mail of any such claim
                    or suit, and cooperate fully (at Your expense) in the defense of
                    such claim or suit. We reserve the right to participate in the
                    defense of such claim or defense at Our own expense, and choose
                    Our own legal counsel; however, We are not obligated to do so.</li>
                <li>Pursuant to the Communications Decency Act ("CDA"), 47 U.S.C.
                    230(c)(1), and court decisions interpreting the scope of
                    the CDA, You acknowledge and understand that We operate, through
                    the Websites, as an interactive computer service provider. Thus,
                    We are immune from, and cannot be held responsible for, claims
                    arising from the publication of third-party content (including
                    third-party User content), appearing on the Websites. We do not
                    create such content, and We are not responsible for the
                    publication or remarks of third-parties that may arguably rise to
                    the level of being actionable under federal or state laws
                    including, but not limited to, the publication of material that
                    might be considered defamatory, or violative of privacy or
                    publicity rights. Note, that federal law allows Us to remove any
                    content found to be offensive, defamatory, obscene or otherwise
                    violative of Our policies, without impacting Our status as a
                    computer service provider. Nothing contained in this paragraph is
                    intended to limit or alter the immunity from claims provided by
                    Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</li>
                <li>You acknowledge and agree that all webcam video communications

                    fraud or for use as evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding
                    in which is may be relevant. You specifically waive and release Us
                    from any claims arising out of such recordation, archiving and
                    subsequent use as outlined above. While we are committed to
                    protecting your privacy, We reserve the right to cooperate in any
                    claim or legal proceeding by releasing archived video footage of

                    direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary,
                    or punitive damages, including without limitation, damages for
                    loss of profits, loss of information, business interruption,
                    revenue, or goodwill, which may arise from any person's use,

                    of such damages. This is for any matter arising out of or relating
                    to this Agreement, whether such liability is asserted on the basis
                    of contract, tort or otherwise, even if We have been advised of

                    month from the accrual of the applicable cause or causes of
                    action. Because some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or
                    limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
                    the above limitation may not apply to You.</li>

                <li>We provide an interactive computer service, and thus we have no
                    liability for user-posted content due to Section 230 of the CDA.
                    Nevertheless, we recognize that despite this protection, there may
                    occasionally be content posted by Our Users that is unappreciated
                    by the subject of the User-posted content. It is not Our intention
                    to cause anguish to any person nor harm to any entity, nor to
                    allow through inaction such harm to occur. Accordingly, it is Our
                    policy to respond respectfully to any complaints about User posted
                    content, or about content that We might have provided.</li>
                <li>If you feel damaged by any User-posted content, or content

                    laws of the California, excluding its conflict of law provisions.
                    The sum of this paragraph is that any and all disputes must be,
                    without exception, brought to court and litigated in California.
                    <ol>
                        <li>All parties to this Agreement agree that all actions or

                            California.</li>
                        <li>The parties agree to <u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction in, and

                            precluding any possibility of litigation between the parties

                <li>Binding Arbitration. If there is a dispute between the parties
                    arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement, the
                    parties shall meet and negotiate in good faith to attempt to
                    resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the
                    dispute through direct negotiations, then, except as otherwise
                    provided herein, either party may submit the issue to binding
                    arbitration in accordance with the then-existing Commercial
                    Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
                    Arbitral Claims shall include, but are not limited to, contract
                    and tort claims of all kinds, and all claims based on any federal,
                    state or local law, statute, or regulation, excepting only claims
                    under applicable worker's compensation law, unemployment insurance
                    claims, actions for injunctions, attachment, garnishment, and
                    other equitable relief. The arbitration shall be conducted in
                    California, and conducted by a single arbitrator, knowledgeable in
                    Internet and e-Commerce disputes. The arbitrator shall have no
                    authority to award any punitive or exemplary damages; certify a
                    class action; add any parties; vary or ignore the provisions of
                    this Agreement; and shall be bound by governing and applicable
                    law. The arbitrator shall render a written opinion setting forth
                    all material facts and the basis of his or her decision within
                    thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding.
                    THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY
                    IN REGARD TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.</li>
                <li>The Arbitrator shall have no authority to award any punitive or
                    exemplary damages; certify a class action; add any parties; vary
                    or ignore the provisions of this Agreement; and shall be bound by
                    governing and applicable law. The arbitrator shall render a
                    written opinion setting forth all material facts and the basis of
                    his or her decision within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of
                    the arbitration proceeding. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS
                    THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.</li>
                <li>No Waiver of Right to Arbitration. There shall be no waiver of
                    the right to arbitration unless such waiver is provided
                    affirmatively and in writing by the waiving party to the other
                    party. There shall be no implied waiver of this right to
                    arbitration. No acts, including the filing of litigation, shall be
                    construed as a waiver or a repudiation of the right to arbitrate.</li>
                <li>The First Amendment Applies to Arbitration Proceedings. Any
                    arbitration tribunal shall consider the First Amendment to the
                    United States Constitution to be in force and effect between the
                    parties. Both parties stipulate to the applicability of the First
                    Amendment's protection of free speech, expression, and
                    association, and both parties stipulate that case law interpreting
                    the First Amendment shall be admissible and considered to be
                    binding authority upon the Arbitrator.</li>
